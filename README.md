conceptual approaches:
1.)4 approaches each approach has three format mean,median,mode so totally 12 datasets.
2.)dimensionality reduction technique for visualising the high-dimmensional  data for finding top two eigen_features.
3.)classifiers knn,logistic_regression,naive_bayes,random_forest,ada_boost,xg_boost,ann(multilayer perceptron).

Models performance:
models performance and complexity is mentioned after every model in the ipynb file provided.

if I had more time I would have gone with the 12 datasets in order to get the one with more precision .Since i have my semister exams going on I did it with only one dataset simple mean replacement for missing values i couldn't concentrate on feature engineering part and ways to find the bottle neck features.

I have attached the ipynb file ,corresponding csv files.

Thanks quartic.ai for giving me this opportunity.
